# Pascal's Triangle in Python

This project implements **Pascal's Triangle** using Python, exploring its connection to the **Binomial Theorem** and binomial coefficients.

## Features
- **Triangle Generation**: Creates the triangle up to a specified number of rows.
- **Visualization**: Displays each row of the triangle in a clear and organized manner.
- **Binomial Coefficient Calculation**: Allows direct access to the binomial coefficients.

## Motivation
This project arose as a personal challenge to combine my passion for **mathematics** and **programming**, providing a tangible representation of fundamental mathematical concepts.

## Usage Instructions

To run the Pascal's Triangle program, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1nfinit0/triPascal.git
cd triPascal
python triPascal.py
```
Second, have fun!
